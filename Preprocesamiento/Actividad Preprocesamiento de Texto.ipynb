Look forward to it. \" @ codyraymille: I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree. # trump2016\" Great! The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped! Thank you so much to http://WND.com for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me! # VoteTrump2016 & together we will # MakeAmericaGreatAgain!

Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: https://m.facebook.com/DonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/utrl0UnQau . @ JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads! . @ JebBush is a low energy \"stiff\" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance! Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant! Hillary Clinton doesn\\'t have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better! I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women\\'s issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I\\'m not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.! Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi. Massive crowds expected.

Fired up and ready to go!!\" Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied! Hillary said that guns don\\'t keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm! Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS! Let\\'s ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can # MakeAmericaGreatAgain!pic.twitter.com/RSZF12Kyhn Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST!

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT! The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch. By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video.http://therightscoop.com/media-gleefully-reporting-al-shabab-video-with-trump-ignores-hillary-and-black-lives-matter-are-in-it-too/ … \"@icareeguns: This # Iowan is voting for @ RealDonaldTrump # IACaucus.

Arrive early! I will be on @ wolfblitzer for a @ CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET. Do you believe that @ UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads?

How stupid, how desperate! . @ Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott. It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted! I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early! . @ SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! I have an idea for @ JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don\\'t be ashamed of it! Weak & ineffective @ JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! Hillary and her friends! https://www.instagram.com/p/BAPvZ-1GhbP/ The @ TheView @ ABC, once great when headed by @ BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad!

He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife\\'s employer, and his lender, is located there! Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn\\'t report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a \"natural born Canadian,\" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?

After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing \"unfairness\" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.

We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @ CNN Ted Cruz didn\\'t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @ RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and \"choice\" - a total lie! Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. I will be interviewed on @ greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @ FoxNews This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. # CruzFraudpic.twitter.com/tRM7KUCrSU The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

Not a leader! I know the \"Governors\" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I\\'m driving her nuts.

No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton! Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me. She is a very dishonest person! While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster! Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary! \" @ RBacliff: Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America\\'s hands. No guns = no protection.

Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong! Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity! Why do the networks continue to put dopey @ BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women? Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can’t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!

Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!

NOT ENOUGH I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you. The failing @ nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don\\'t have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I\\'m beating her. The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez! I am always on the front page of the failing @ nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I\\'m in the back of the paper. Very dishonest! Don\\'t believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\\'s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. # MDW Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them. Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit! Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do. Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can\\'t control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R\\'s! The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can\\'t allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate! If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court! Obama says a WALL at our southern border won\\'t enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H. In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate.

Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION! When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess! I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton. Hillary says this election is about judgment. She\\'s right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. How can Hillary run the economy when she can\\'t even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? Hillary Clinton\\'s open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe. Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T. They have bankrupted… https://www.instagram.com/p/BG7IYzumhZw/ I am \"the king of debt.\"That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S. Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. If you want to know about Hillary Clinton\\'s honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens. Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.

Win I don\\'t think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with \"murder.\" Come November 8, she\\'s out! Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" Not fit! Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.

She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come! I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @ KarlRove Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn\\'t get indicted while Bob M did? I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. \" @ Theresa_Cali: @ realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! # MakeAmericaSafeAgain\" The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn\\'t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven\\'t had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don\\'t look presidential to me! The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! \" @ OliMauritania: @ realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/22/tim-kaine-boycotted-netanyahus-iran-deal-speech/ … # HillaryKaine2016\" \"@NancyNielsenn: @ realDonaldTrump Dinesh D\\'Sousa Hillary\\'s America. see it\" # MakeAmericaGreatAgain # TrumpPence16pic.twitter.com/gCzHX1nyxD The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT Wow, President Obama\\'s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. There is no longer a Bernie Sanders \"political revolution.\" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can\\'t go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! Today proves what I have always known, that @ Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz ( @ DWStweets.) I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! The @ CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @ FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don\\'t watch CNN! If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don\\'t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she\\'s out! The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America\\'s problems. ISIS & all others laughing! The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! Thank you! # MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzam If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that\\'s all! They laughed at Bernie. Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! Great POLL numbers are coming out all over.

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! I was at @ FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Funny, if you listen to @ FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day.

Please get your facts straight - thanks. @ megynkelly No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! Many of Bernie\\'s supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry-mcauliffe-hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-226253 … As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Funny how the failing @ nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said \"Trump is a genius.\" America 1st! The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! Hillary\\'s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. Hillary\\'s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @ CNN and the little watched @ Morning_Joe = SAD! Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and \"forgot\" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead.

The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds! Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it.

A formula for disaster! # CrookedHillarypic.twitter.com/xyoPFJmByp Why doesn\\'t the media want to report that on the two \"Big Thursdays\" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican\\'s won ratings I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania.

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP 32.2 MILLION. CLINTON 27.8 MILLION. Thank you! Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our \"leaders\" to eradicate it! I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? \" @ RealJamesWoods: Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn\\'t stand a chance. # VoterFraud and # MSM her only hope.\" Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @ nytimes is a joke. @ CNN is laughable! Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! When I said in an interview that Putin is \"not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,\" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push.

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary\\'s pay-for-play at State Department? Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.

The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before Happy 241st birthday to the U.S. Marine Corps! Thank you for your service!!pic.twitter.com/Lz2dhrXzo4 A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government! Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. # ThankAVetpic.twitter.com/wPk7QWpK8Z This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! Wow, the @ nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"Trump phenomena\" The @ nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice! Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible! The @ nytimes states today that DJT believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" How dishonest are they. I never said this! I will be interviewed on @ 60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win! If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! I am not trying to get \"top level security clearance\" for my children. This was a typically false news story. The failing @ nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @ nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @ nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. # MAGA Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country. The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad! Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I watched parts of @ nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us? General James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General\\'s General! I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news! . @ transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days.pic.twitter.com/HTgPXfPWeJ Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! Many people would like to see @ Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! I cancelled today\\'s meeting with the failing @ nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @ nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone! The failing @ nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce? Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. \\'President-elect Donald J. Trump\\'s CIA Director Garners Praise\\' http://bit.ly/2gghLjvPOMPEO pic.twitter.com/MrPaG7OziQ \\'Jeff Sessions, a Fitting Selection for Attorney General\\'http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442334/jeff-sessions-attorney-general-justice-department-trump-administration … The meeting with the @ nytimes is back on at 12:30 today. Look forward to it! I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I\\'ve gotten to know him well--he\\'s a greatly talented person who loves people! Bus crash in Tennessee so sad & so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered! Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead. Happy Thanksgiving.pic.twitter.com/yH6LYdS2ts Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! Fidel Castro is dead! The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore! Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change Hillary\\'s debate answer on delay: \"That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We\\'ve had free -- and fair elections. We\\'ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a - during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind -- of position.\" Then, separately she stated, \"He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of -- this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy.\" She then said, \"We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald -- Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn\\'t the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed! \" @ HighonHillcrest: @ jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @ CNN\" \" @ JoeBowman12: @ jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !\" @ CNN still doesn\\'t get it. They will never learn! \" @ FiIibuster: @ jeffzeleny Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter. \" @ sdcritic: @ HighonHillcrest @ jeffzeleny @ CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT # voterfraud did take place, and in favor of # CorruptHillary !\" . @ CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don\\'t know what to do. The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306! I thought that @ CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse! Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe! \\'President-Elect Donald J.

While I am not mandated to .... do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses..

Our great VPE, @ mike_pence, is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate. John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington. Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can\\'t get any worse. Sad The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. ...... without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but..... these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ... expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount. Just a Stein scam to raise money! . @ FoxNews will be re-running \"Objectified: Donald Trump,\" the ratings hit produced by the great Harvey Levin of TMZ, at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy! Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.. their country (the U.S. doesn\\'t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?

I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME! As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun! Reports by @ CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS! A very interesting read.

I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON! Whether I choose him or not for \"State\"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! Will be interviewed on @ FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy! Just watched @ NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can\\'t get much worse, although @ CNN is right up there! Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! Unless you catch \"hackers\" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn\\'t this brought up before election? The F-35 program and cost is out of control.

Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times! I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!

Our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase: # MadeInTheUSA!pic.twitter.com/O3RBYD2dT3 We should tell China that we don\\'t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it! If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking! We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). \" @ Franklin_Graham: Congratulations to President-elect @ realDonaldTrump--the electoral votes are in and it\\'s official.\" Thank you Franklin! \" @ mike_pence: Congratulations to @ RealDonaldTrump; officially elected President of the United States today by the Electoral College!\" Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He \"doesn\\'t know much\" ... especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY! Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people! The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont: https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10158338539250725 … Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase \"DRAIN THE SWAMP\" was no longer being used by me. Actually, we will always be trying to DTS. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! The so-called \"A\" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE! My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with... my presidency. Isn\\'t this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer! As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th. The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, \"by God\\'s will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will...... slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back? Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: \"In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.\" So true! . @ NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: \"until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\" Dishonest! The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway! Happy # Hanukkahpic.twitter.com/UvZwtykV1E # MerryChristmaspic.twitter.com/5GgDmJrGMS Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone! President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad! The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won\\'t report! The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities! President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald! Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but....... not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching! \\'Economists say Trump delivered hope\\'http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-economy-consumer-confidence-233011 … My Administration will follow two simple rules: https://instagram.com/p/BOmuafXjnVB/ Great move on delay (by V.

 a real dummy    ted cruz didn t win iowa  he stole it  that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated  bad  during primetime of the iowa caucus  cruz put out a release that   was quitting the race  and to caucus  or vote  for cruz  many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud  also  cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters  the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter grade of f  and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz  fraud and finally  cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers  voters  that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and  choice    a total lie  based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus  either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified  i will be interviewed on   at 7 00 p m  enjoy    this was sent out from ted cruz  as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote    twitter com

you become potus     the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine  who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for  philly fight  tim kaine is  and always has been  owned by the banks  bernie supporters are outraged  was their last choice  bernie fought for nothing  pocahontas wanted v p  slot so badly but wasn t chosen because she has done nothing in the senate  also  crooked hillary hates her  leaked e mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders  mock his heritage and much more  on line from wikileakes  really vicious  rigged crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania  against steelworkers and miners  husband signed nafta  funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs  i will bring jobs back  tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved  job killer  i will bring jobs back and get wages up  people haven t had a real wage increase in almost twenty years  clinton killed jobs  just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together  isis and our other enemies are drooling  they don t look presidential to me  the wikileaks e mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her  unless he is a fraud  thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night  from the heart         kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals http   www breitbart com big government 2016 07 22 tim kaine boycotted

all of his supporters  just another case of bad judgement by h  bernie sanders started off strong  but with the selection of kaine for v p   is ending really weak  so much for a movement  total disrespect wow  president obama s brother  malik  just announced that he is voting for me  was probably treated badly by president like everybody else  looks like the bernie people will fight  if not  their blood  sweat and tears was a total waste of time  kaine stands for opposite  an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates  there is no longer a bernie sanders  political revolution   he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end  sorry folks  but bernie sanders is exhausted  just can t go on any longer  he is trying to dismiss the new e mails and dnc disrespect  sad  today proves what i have always known  that   priebus is the tough one and the smart one  not debbie wasserman shultz       i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated  the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted  no energy left  the   panels are so one sided  almost all against trump    is so much better and the ratings are much higher  don t watch cnn  if the republican convention had blown up with e mails  resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player   bernie   media would go wild crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top  dws  too bad bernie flamed out even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength  i don t believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook  the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing  e mails say the rigged system is alive   well  the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that  after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory  she s out  the ratings for the republican national convention were very good  but for the final night  my speech  great  thank you  watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes  no way they are going to fix america s problems  isis   all others laughing  the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e mails  which should never have been written  stupid   because putin likes me how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e mails  using even religion  against bernie  hillary was involved in the e mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened  thank you    twitter com pzs9uwgzam if bernie sanders  after seeing the just released e mails  continues to look exhausted and done  then his legacy will never be the same  crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her  servant  was doing at the dnc   they just got caught  that s all  they laughed at bernie  here we go again with another clinton scandal  and e mails yet  can you believe   crooked hillary knew the fix was in  b never had a chance  wow  the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess  but fear not  the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn  the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change  great poll numbers are coming out all over  people don t want another four years of obama  and crooked hillary would be even worse      https   www facebook com donaldtrump posts 10157368945620725 0

 happy thanksgiving pic twitter com yh6lyds2ts happy thanksgiving to everyone  we will  together  make america great again  i am working hard  even on thanksgiving  trying to get carrier a c  company to stay in the u s   indiana   making progress   will know soon  fidel castro is dead  the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated   demoralized dems the democrats  when they incorrectly thought they were going to win  asked that the election night tabulation be accepted  not so anymore  hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in  nothing will change hillary s debate answer on delay   that is horrifying  that is not the way our democracy works  been around for 240 years  we ve had free    and fair elections  we ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them  and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   during a general election  i  for one  am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind    of position   then  separately she stated   he said something truly horrifying     he refused to say that he would respect the results of    this election  that is a direct threat to our democracy   she then said   we have to accept the results and look to the future  donald    trump is going to be our president  we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead   so much time and money will be spent   same result  sad in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally it would have been much easier for me to win the so called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4   states instead of the 15 states that i visited  i would have won even more easily and convincingly  but smaller states are forgotten   serious voter fraud in virginia  new hampshire and california   so why isn t the media reporting on this  serious bias   big problem  if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people  the cuban american people and the u s  as a whole  i will terminate deal  just met with general petraeus  was very impressed         what proof do u have donaldtrump did not suffer from millions of fraud votes  journalist  do your job            just another generic cnn part time wannabe journalist      still doesn t get it  they will never learn         pathetic   you have no sufficient evidence that donald trump did not suffer from voter fraud  shame  bad reporter             there is no question that   did take place  and in favor of          is so embarrassed by their total  100   support of hillary clinton  and yet her loss in a landslide  that they don t know what to do  the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory   306  i thought that   would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however  since election  they are worse  nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag   if they do  there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail  my thoughts and prayers are with the great people of tennessee during these terrible wildfires  stay safe

and then thinks it will sell its product back into the u s         without retribution or consequence  is wrong  there will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35  for these companies        wanting to sell their product  cars  a c  units etc   back across the border  this tax will make leaving financially difficult  but      these companies are able to move between all 50 states  with no

an unlimited budget  out to vote in the vital swing states   and more   they focused on wrong states yes  it is true   carlos slim  the great businessman from mexico  called me about getting together for a meeting  we met  he is a great guy  campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult   sophisticated than the popular vote  hillary focused on the wrong states  i would have done even better in the election  if that is possible  if the winner was based on popular vote   but would campaign differently i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss  i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today  talking about airplane capability and pricing  very impressive people

i swear  we will       slaughter you  this is a purely religious threat  which turned into reality  such hatred  when will the u s   and all countries  fight back  vladimir putin said today about hillary and dems   in my opinion  it is humiliating  one must be able to lose with dignity   so true      purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute   until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes   dishonest  the big loss yesterday for israel in the united nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace too bad  but we will get it done anyway  happy   twitter com
